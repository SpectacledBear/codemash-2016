# My God, it's Full of Tests

This is the repository for a talk I gave at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/) 2016. The slides for this talk can be found [here](slides.pdf).

To build this project from the Command Prompt in Windows, run the [00_Initialize script](00_Initialize.bat). You can alternatively build the project in Visual Studio. This repository at least requires Visual Studio 2015, or the equivalent build tools, and NuGet.

This repository is licensed using the MIT license. The license text can be found in the [LICENSE file](LICENSE).
